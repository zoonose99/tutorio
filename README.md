These are resources for an AIML bot, but don't use them and maybe don't use AIML at all. Just look at the nightmare that's contained, eg, in the rhyming dictionary file! There's no option for reversable searches, so the (dubious) assertion that "Martha" rhymes with "Buddha" also requires an entry asserting that "Buddha" rhymes with "Martha." What hell is this? It's like the last 50 years of computer science never happened.
